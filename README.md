# Random Bangladesh Phone Number Generator
This is a fun project which I made in free time. This javafx application helps generate random Bangladesh Phone Numbers each time the user requests for it. 
<br>
## Here consists of 7 different operators to choose:
-  Grameenphone
-  Airtel
-  Teletalk
-  Banglalink
-  Grameenphone (New)
-  Banglalink (New)
-  Robi

### User can also choose their own sequence and play with it.

# How to use it?
-  Make sure you have installed the latest java in your system
-  Download the jar file from release section
